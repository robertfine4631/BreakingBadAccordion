    <p>Option A, you kill me right here and now. Apparently I've made that very easy for you. You can kill me, no witnesses and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you kill him too. A pointless exercise it seems to me but that is Option A.I continue cooking, you and I both forget about Pinkman. We forget this ever happened. We consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement. I prefer Option B. </p>

    <p>This is glass grade. I mean, you got... Jesus, you got crystals in here 2 inches, 3 inches long. This is pure glass. You're a damn artist! This is art, Mr. White! Yeah, that's the thing, y'know? Your scumbag brother-in-law took my rainy day fund. Oh yeah. And tell that douche bag brother-in-law of yours to go towards the light. </p>

    <p>No shit! Right now you're Fredo. But, y'know, with some sound advice and proper introductions, who knows? I'll tell you one thing: you've got the right product. Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch, you're onto something special. And I would like to be a small and silent part of it. Food for thought, yeah? So if you want to make more money and keep the money that you make, better call Saul! Better safe than sorry. That's my motto. Yeah, you do seem to have a little 'shit creek' action going. You know, FYI, you can buy a paddle. Did you not plan for this contingency? I mean the Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button. I'm just saying. </p>

    <p>No, you're just speaking for me! Like I ain't got the goddamn sense to speak for myself! Is that it? Is that what you're doing? Heisenberg says, 'Relax'!What's your name? Have a seat, Heisenberg. What is this shit? This is blue. TIGHT! Tight, tight, YEAH! Oh, blue, yellow, pink. Whatever, man. Just keep bringing me that. Alright. Money up front. Sometimes you got to rob to keep your riches, just as long as we got an understanding. </p>

    <p>What kind of man talks to the DEA? No man. No man at all. A crippled little rata. What a reputation to leave behind. Is that how you want to be remembered? Last chance to look at me, Hector. Can I help you sir? What can I do for you? I'm... sorry, I'm not following. I... think that you're confusing me for someone else. Sir, if you have a complaint, I suggest you submit it through our email system. I will be happy to refer you to our website. I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White. You are not a cautious man at all. Your partner was late and he was high. He's high often, isn't he? You have poor judgement. I can't work with someone with poor judgement. I've been told, it's excellent. That is not the only factor. I have to ask... why? Why him? How much product do you have on hand? I have your numbers. You can never trust a drug addict. </p>
